## Analysis

- Merged data gives the complete result of each mouse by its Mouse ID.
-Duplicate row is droped from Dataframe.
-The summary statistics shows the effectiveness of each drug in various forms- Data shows 'Ramicane' is most effective on tumors followed by 'Capomulin' and 'Ketapril' shows least effectiveness.
-Bar charts depicst the most Mouse were observed under 'Capomulin' drug and least under 'Propriva' drug regimen.
-Pie chart represent the gender distribution of Mice, with males slightly higher than female.
- Data shows that among "Capomulin", "Ramicane", "Infubinol", "Ceftamin" drug regimens, only 'Infubinol' shows the outlier in it.
- Line graph shows the correlation between the 'Tumor Volume (mm3) and 'Timepoint'. As the mouse is treated by the drug the Tumor volume falls down in uncertain way.
-Scatter graph shows the correlation between the mouse weight and Tumor Volume. It shows the positive relation between both. We also calculated correaltion coeficient which is positive.
